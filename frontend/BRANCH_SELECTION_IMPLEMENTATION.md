# Branch Selection System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a streamlined branch selection system where users select a branch once after login, and this selection persists throughout their session.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Redux Store Updates (`src/redux/accessSlice.jsx`)
- Added `selectedBranch` state to store the selected branch object
- Added `branchSelected` boolean to track if a branch has been selected
- Added `setBranch` action to set the selected branch
- Added `clearBranch` action to clear branch selection
- Branch data is persisted in localStorage

### 2. Protected Route Updates (`src/redux/protectedRoute.jsx`)
- Modified to check both authentication and branch selection
- Shows BranchSelection component if authenticated but no branch selected
- Only allows access to main app if both authenticated and branch selected

### 3. New Branch Selection Page (`src/pages/branchSelection.jsx`)
- Dedicated page for branch selection shown after login
- Auto-selects if only one branch available
- Includes logout functionality
- Stores selected branch in Redux and localStorage

### 4. Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/useBranch.js`)
- `useSelectedBranch()` - Returns the full selected branch object
- `useBranchId()` - Returns just the branch ID
- `useBranchSelected()` - Returns boolean if branch is selected

### 5. Branch Selector Component (`src/components/branchSelector.jsx`)
- Displays current selected branch in sidebar
- Allows users to change branch selection
- Shows branch name and provides change branch option

### 6. Updated App.jsx Routing
- Removed all `/branch/:branchId` route patterns
- Simplified routes to use selected branch from Redux
- Branch selection is handled at the authentication level

### 7. Sidebar Updates (`src/components/allsidebar.jsx`)
- Added BranchSelector component to show current branch
- Users can easily see and change their selected branch

## How to Update Individual Pages

For pages that previously used `const { branchId } = useParams()`, update them as follows:

### Before:
```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { branchId } = useParams();
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### After:
```jsx
import { useBranchId } from '@/hooks/useBranch';

function MyComponent() {
  const branchId = useBranchId();
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Navigation Updates
Update navigation calls to remove branch parameters:

### Before:
```jsx
navigate(`/purchases/branch/${branchId}/form`)
navigate(`/inventory/branch/${branchId}`)
```

### After:
```jsx
navigate(`/purchases/form`)
navigate(`/inventory`)
```

## Pages That Need Updates

The following pages still need to be updated to use the new branch selection system:

1. All form components in `/components/`
2. All page components in `/pages/`
3. Any components that use `useParams()` to get `branchId`

## Benefits

1. **Faster Navigation**: No need to select branch for every page
2. **Better UX**: Users select branch once and it persists
3. **Cleaner URLs**: Simplified routing without branch parameters
4. **Consistent State**: Branch selection stored in Redux for global access
5. **Persistence**: Selected branch survives page refreshes

## Implementation Status

✅ Redux store setup
✅ Protected route with branch selection
✅ Branch selection page
✅ Custom hooks for branch access
✅ Branch selector component
✅ Updated App.jsx routing
✅ Updated sidebar with branch selector
✅ Example page update (AllPurchaseTransactions)

⏳ Remaining: Update all other pages and components to use new branch system
